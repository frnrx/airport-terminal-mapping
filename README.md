This is a airport terminal mapping app built in React.

To make it work you have to input coordinates separeted by `,` in the format of a bounding box. You can get the coordinates at `http://bboxfinder.com/#`.

## To run the app

```
yarn
yarn start
```

## To run the tests

`yarn test`

## Technical summary

For this project, the focus on the implementation of the features was keeping it as simple as possible by using mostly React ready features, like ReactJS, vanilla CSS, and react-testing-library, and with the addition of react-leaftlet to achieve a simple visual representation of the dataset.

For improvements, it would be nice to test the react-leaftlet implementation in-depth.
